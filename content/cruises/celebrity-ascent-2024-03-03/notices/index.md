*Note:* I wouldn't consider this information entirely correct. The notice advises that "all \[restaurants\] feature the same mouthwatering menu that changes nightly" but indeed, each main dining room has unique, themed dishes: three appetizers, three entrees, and a dessert in each venue.

These options may not be available in the other restaurants, or only some of them based on shared kitchen/galley location.
